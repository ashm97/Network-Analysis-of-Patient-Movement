    "The key idea is that the ordering and timing in which time-stamped edges occur in a `TemporalNetwork` gives rise to so-called **causal or time-respecting paths**. In a nutshell, for two time-stamped edges $(a, b, t)$ and $(b, c, t')$ to contribute to a causal path $a \\rightarrow b \\rightarrow c$ it must hold that $t < t'$. If we swap timestamps such that the edge $(b, c)$ occurs **before** (a,b), no causal path $a \\rightarrow b \\rightarrow c$ exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we observe that the chronological order of time-stamped edges crucially influences causal paths, i.e. which nodes can possibly influence each other in time-stamped edge sequences. Moreover, we often want to limit the **maximum time difference between consecutive edges** that contribute to a causal path. For data on dynamic social interactions that spans several years, it does not make sense to consider all chronologically ordered edges as possible causal paths for the propagation of information. After all, humans have limited memory and we should thus consider interactions that occur far apart in time as independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can formally add this condition by setting a maximum time difference $\\delta$ for the path calculation. That is, we only consider two edges $(a, b, t)$ and $(b, c, t')$ to contribute to a causal path $a \\rightarrow b \\rightarrow c$ if $ 0 < t' - t \\leq \\delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this definition at hand, and by setting our maximum time difference $\\delta$, we can now **calculate causal path statistics in time-stamped network data**. `pathpy` provides powerful algorithms to calculate (or estimate) causal path statistics based on a `TemporalNetwork` instance. Let us try this in our toy example."

    "So far, we have studied higher-order network models for path data with a fixed, given order $k$. We have seen that such higher-order models can yield better predictions compared to standard network models. But we have also come across some open questions. For the US Flight data, we have seen that we could improve the prediction performance by moving from a first- to a second-order model. However, we did not see a further improvement for the third-order model. So in practice, how can we decide **at which order we should model a given system**? In fact, this points to a more general question. It is easy to imagine systems for which path statistics do not deviate significantly from the transitive, Markovian assumption made by a first-order network model. So we **need a methods to decide when higher-order models are actually needed**.\n",

    "Moreover, a higher-order model with order $k$ can only capture higher-order dependencies at a single fixed correlation length $k$. But we may encounter data that exhibit multiple correlation lengths at once. This raises the question how we  can combine models with multiple higher orders into a multi-order model.\n",

    "This confirms our expectation that the second-order null model actually has the same likelihood as the first-order model. It also highlights an interesting way to test hypotheses about higher-order correlations in paths. We can use a likelihood ratio test to compare the likelihood of the null hypothesis (i.e. a second-order representation of the first-order model) with the likelihood of an alternative hypothesis (the *fitted* second-order model).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what do we learn from th fact that the likelihood of a model increases as we increase the order of the model. By itself, not much. The reason for this is that higher-order models are typicall more complex than first-order models, i.e. while fitting their transition matrix, we actually fit more parameters to the data. We can thus expect that they better explain our observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should remind ourselves about Occam's razor, which states that we should favor models that make fewer assumptions. That is, in the comparison of the model likelihoods we should account for the additional complexity (or degrees of freedom) of a higher-order model over the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice feature of our framework is that the null model and the alternative model are actually **nested**, i.e. the null model is one particular point in the parameter space of the (more general) higher-order model. Thanks to this property, we can apply [Wilk's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test#Distribution:_Wilks’_theorem) to derive an analytical expression for the $p$-value of the null hypothesis that second-order correlations are absent (i.e. that a first-order model is sufficient to explain the observed paths), compared to the alternative hypothesis that a second-order model is needed. You can find the mathematical details of this hypothesis testing technique in the following KDD'17 paper:\n",

    "To fix this issue, we need probabilistic generative models that can deal with large collections of (short) paths in a network. The key idea is to combine multiple higher-order network models into a single multi-layered, multi-order model. To calculate the likelihood of such a model based on a set of observed paths, we can use all layers, thus avoiding the problem that we discard prefixes of paths. For each path, we start at a layer of order zero, which considers the relative probabilities of nodes. We use this model layer to calculate the probability to observe the first node on a path. For the next transition to step two, we then use a first-order model. The next transition is calculated in the second-order model and so on, until we have reached the maximum order of our multi-order model. At this point, we can transitively calculate the likelihood based on the remaining transitions of the path.\n",
